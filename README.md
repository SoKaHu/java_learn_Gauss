# java_learn_Gauss
Learning Java part 4 - matrices, implementing methods

This was coded as part of a TUM introduction in programming course.
The program is a UTF8-coded java file. The MiniJava file was provided by the chair of Algorithms and Complexity of TU Munich.

Instructions:
This program should implement a simplified version of the Gaussian elimination method. We assume that the given equation system has a distinct solution. 
The Gaussian elimination method transforms the matrix into row/step form with the following operations: multiplication, addition and exchange of two rows.

Note: Only use onedimensional arrays to solve this task.
